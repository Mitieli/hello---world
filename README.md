# hello---world

First Public Repository: created 10th December, 2020.

New to this. Created this repository to familiarise myself with GitHub and its features such as creating a repository, creating a branch, making and commit changes and opening a pull request.
The purpose of joining GitHub is to use it as my online portfolio.
